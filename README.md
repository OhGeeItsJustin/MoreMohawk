# MoreMohawk
Capstone project for Mohawk College

# Project Background
When new student first-year students come to Mohawk College they might not know their way around the building or know all the features that Mohawk has to offer for students. Mohawk orientation can help provide some of information that the first-year students will need but some of the students might forget that information or that information isn't mentioned during orientation. Most of the first-year students have mobile phones so providing this information in an application would be able to impact almost all the new students. Currently there is already a mobile phone application for Mohawk College, but it does a poor job at displaying only the necessary information that a first-year student would need to be prepared for the start of their semester.
My proposal offer to this situation is building an application for mohawk college first year students that will provide only the necessary information that a first-year student will need and no unnecessary information that they won’t need.
